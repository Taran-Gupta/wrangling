    "**Question 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The paper is about the advantages of \"tidy\" datasets when it comes to data cleaning, and what structure/manipulation is necessary to achieve these datasets. Each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and each observational unit is a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. It is intended to create a standard method of organization of data within a dataset to make it easier to read/work with, and encourage initial data exploration and simplify the use of multiple data analysis tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. All tidy datasets are structure in the same way, and thus should be similar. The data that is initially given though, which is untidy, presents their own unique problems (different NA values, unclear codebooks, inconsistent formatting, etc.). Datasets will not have the exact same problems wrong with them, and thus (at our level, for now), the data needs human eyes on it to determine what the problems are and how to mitigate the issues. When given a data set, it is pretty clear that each row represents an observation while the columns keep track of the variables. However when assmebling data oneself or trying to generally define the terms, it becomes less clear if something is a variable or observation as they could be organized in more than one way. For example, height and width could both be integer variables with their own columns, or they could be values taken on by the variable dimension. The organization of the data in columns and rows dictates which is \"correct\".\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Values are the collection of quantitative and qualitative data (numbers and strings) that make up a dataset. Variables are values grouped by similar attributes (columns: height, temperature) whereas observations are a group of data across variables for one particular \"instance\" of measurement (or a unit) (rows: person, day, region).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Tidy data, as opposed to messy data, is defined as data that has variables forming the columns and observations forming the rows. Each observational unit must form a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are: column headers are not names and instead values, multiple variables are stored in one column, variables are stored in both rows and columns, multiple observational units are in the same table, and a single observational unit are in multiple tables. Table 4 is messy because the column headers are values instead of variable names (income), and both the rows and the columns represent variables whereas teh values are the frequencies/observations. Melting a data set refers to stacking or expanding the data, where columns are turned into rows. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. The year, month, and day column were combined into one date column which got rid of a lot of empty values (since day is really a value). Furthermore, tmax and tmin were extracted as 2 columns instead of \"element\" deciding what \"value\" actually describes. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. The chicken-and-egg problem is referring to the link between tidy data and tools for tidy data. If the data changes structure, then the tools will no longer work, and if the tools change to improve efficiency/workflow, then it wouldn't work on the now \"untidy\" data. Changing one requires changing both or creating work arounds. Wickham hopes that data continues to become more organizable and clear, and that the tools keep improving as well. They hope that data scientists think about this problem and work constructively on it instead of just using the information in the paper presented mindlessly. "
